The objective is to implement the approach outlined in the paper within the framework of the Tacotron1 model (based on the full-sentence method,
code available here: https://github.com/ttaoREtw/Tacotron-pytorch) and to be able to generate a small TTS system incrementally.

In order to do that, I have studied the document "2020.findings-emnlp.346.pdf" and edit the precedent model.
